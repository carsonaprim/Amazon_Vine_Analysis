# Amazon_Vine_Analysis
## Overview
Trying to manipulate data to find some value in the review data given, seeing if the Vine reviews / non-Vine reviews revealed different levels of satisfaction
## Results
### Vine Reviews
- 44 5 stars
- 90 total
- 48.9%
### Non-Vine Reviews
- 14704 5 stars
- 37831 total
- 38.9%
## Summary
in review, there is clearly positive bias for reviews in the Vine program, as it clearly, albeit unintentionally precisely, increased the 5 star review percentage by 10% and in data not asked for, the average review was .8 stars higher as well, which would be another analysis to go after to help support this argument
